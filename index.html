        <p>Hi, my name is Andrew Hosek. I am an undergraduate Computer Science student that is making my way through college and internships to become a software engineer. 
          When I'm not in school I like to work on personal programming projects. I really like writing in python, although recently I have took up a lot C# and WPF using 
          MVVM architecture. Other than programming, one of my hobbies I love to do is to snowboard in the winter. I also hang out with friends and family very often.
